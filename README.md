OneTrust CMP Template

Google Consent Mode allows you to adjust how your Google tags behave based on the consent given or not given by your users through OneTrust Cookie Compliance. You can indicate whether consent has been granted for Analytics and/or Ads cookies and Google's tags will dynamically adapt by only utilizing cookies for the specified purposes or cookie categories. This is an alternative to script blocking.

In the OneTrust CMP Template, you can associate your OneTrust purpose IDs with the consent key settings so that consent key setting defaults and updates will occur based on user consent.
